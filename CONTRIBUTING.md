-   **Human Oversight**: As the contributor, you are responsible for the final code. Always review, understand, and validate AI-generated code.
-   **Maintain Quality**: Ensure that all contributions, whether human or AI-assisted, meet the standards outlined in this document.

## 📋 How to Contribute

We welcome several types of contributions:

1.  **Code Contributions**: Implementing new features, fixing bugs, or refactoring existing code.
2.  **Documentation Contributions**: Improving `README.md` files, adding examples, clarifying instructions, or fixing typos.
3.  **Content Contributions**: Writing tutorials, blog posts, or educational content for associated platforms like `it-journey.dev`.
4.  **Community Contributions**: Answering questions in discussions, reviewing pull requests, or mentoring other contributors.

### Getting Started

1.  **Find an issue** or **propose an idea**: Check the `Issues` tab to find existing tasks or open a new one to discuss your proposed changes.
2.  **Fork the repository**: Create your own copy of the repository to work on.
3.  **Create a branch**: Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/add-new-widget` or `fix/login-bug`).
4.  **Make your changes**: Follow the development principles and coding standards outlined below.
5.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Once your changes are ready, open a PR and provide a clear description of what you've done.

## 🚀 Core Development Principles

All contributions should adhere to the following principles:

-   **Design for Failure (DFF)**: Implement robust error handling, logging, and fallback mechanisms.
-   **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Create reusable functions, modules, and components.
-   **Keep It Simple (KIS)**: Prefer clear, readable code over complex or "clever" solutions.

### 📖 README-First, README-Last

This is a **critical workflow rule**. Documentation is not an afterthought; it is an integral part of the development process.

#### 🔍 README-FIRST: Start with Documentation

Before writing any code:

1.  **Locate and read** the relevant `README.md` file(s) to understand the context, purpose, and existing structure of the module you are working on.
2.  **Assess documentation gaps**: Identify what is missing, outdated, or unclear.

#### ✅ README-LAST: Update Documentation After Changes

After completing your code changes:

1.  **Update the `README.md`** to reflect your changes. Document new files, features, or functionalities.
2.  **Ensure all documentation is accurate**, links are working, and examples are correct.
3.  **Update the `lastmod` date** in the frontmatter if the `README.md` has it.

##  Git Workflow

### Branching

Please follow these branch naming conventions:

-   `feature/<description>`: For new features.
-   `fix/<description>`: For bug fixes.
-   `docs/<description>`: For documentation-only changes.
-   `refactor/<description>`: For code refactoring without functional changes.
-   `chore/<description>`: For maintenance tasks (e.g., updating dependencies).

### Commit Messages

We follow the **Conventional Commits** specification. This makes the commit history more readable and allows for automated changelog generation.

**Format**:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Example**:
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality

Implement the complete password reset flow, including email
notifications and a secure token-based reset mechanism.

Fixes #42
```

-   **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`.
-   **Scope**: The part of the codebase the commit affects (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `docs`).

## 🏗️ Monorepo Workflow

This repository uses **Git submodules** to manage multiple related projects. Understanding how to work with submodules is essential for contributing.

### Repository Structure

```
bamr87/
├── cv/          # Submodule: CV Builder application
├── README/      # Submodule: Documentation hub
├── scripts/     # Submodule: Automation scripts
└── (root)       # Profile README and coordination
```

For detailed information, see [docs/MONOREPO.md](docs/MONOREPO.md).

### Contributing to Root Repository

For changes to root-level files (README.md, .gitignore, workflows, shared configs):

1. **Fork** the main repository: `https://github.com/bamr87/bamr87`
2. **Clone** with submodules:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/bamr87.git
   cd bamr87
   ```
3. **Create a branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```
4. **Make changes** to root-level files only
5. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your descriptive message"
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request** to the main repository

### Contributing to Submodules

For changes to cv/, README/, or scripts/:

#### Option 1: Direct Submodule Contribution (Recommended)

1. **Fork the submodule repository** (e.g., `https://github.com/bamr87/cv-builder-pro`)
2. **Clone and work directly** in the submodule repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cv-builder-pro.git
   cd cv-builder-pro
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   # Make changes
   git commit -m "feat: your feature"
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```
3. **Open a PR** to the submodule repository
4. **After merge**, the parent repository will be updated automatically via CI/CD

#### Option 2: Work Through Parent Repository

1. **Clone parent with submodules**:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/bamr87/bamr87.git
   cd bamr87
   ```
2. **Navigate to submodule** and create branch:
   ```bash
   cd cv
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```
3. **Make changes and commit** in the submodule:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your feature"
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```
4. **Return to parent and update pointer**:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   git add cv
   git commit -m "chore: update cv submodule with feature"
   git push
   ```
5. **Open PRs** for both the submodule and parent repository

### Submodule Update Process

When you see "Update submodule" PRs:

1. **Review the submodule changes** by clicking the commit hash
2. **Test the changes** locally:
   ```bash
   git checkout pr-branch
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   cd cv  # or relevant submodule
   npm install && npm run dev  # or appropriate commands
   ```
3. **Approve and merge** if tests pass

### Testing Across Submodules

Before submitting PRs that affect multiple submodules:

1. **Test each submodule independently**
2. **Test integration** by running from the root:
   ```bash
   ./tools/run-all-tests.sh
   ```
3. **Document dependencies** between submodules in your PR description

### Submodule Best Practices

-   ✅ **Always commit submodule changes first**, then update parent
-   ✅ **Test submodule changes independently** before updating parent
-   ✅ **Use descriptive commit messages** mentioning the submodule
-   ✅ **Keep submodules on stable branches** (main/master)
-   ❌ **Don't make unrelated changes** in multiple submodules in one PR
-   ❌ **Don't update parent pointer** without merging submodule changes first

## 💻 Code and Documentation Standards

### General Standards

-   **Code Style**: Follow the existing code style. Use linters and formatters where provided.
-   **File Headers**: Include a standardized header in all source files, as defined in the project's instruction files.
-   **Comments**: Explain the "why," not the "what." Code should be self-documenting.

### Language-Specific Guidelines

-   **Python**: Follow PEP 8. Use type hints and `black` for formatting.
-   **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Use Prettier for formatting and ESLint for linting. Prefer TypeScript for new projects.
-   **Bash/Shell**: Use `shellcheck` to validate scripts. Include `set -euo pipefail` for robustness.

### Documentation

-   **READMEs are essential**: Every directory should have a `README.md` explaining its purpose.
-   **Docstrings/JSDoc**: All public functions, classes, and modules must have complete documentation.
-   **Front Matter**: Use the standardized front matter for all content and instruction files to provide context for both humans and AI.

## 🧪 Testing

-   **Write tests**: All new features and bug fixes must be accompanied by tests.
-   **High Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage to ensure reliability.
-   **CI/CD**: All tests will be run automatically via GitHub Actions when you open a PR. Ensure they pass.

## 🤝 Pull Request (PR) Process

1.  **Create a Draft PR** early in the process to get feedback.
2.  **Ensure your PR is focused**: A PR should address a single issue or feature.
3.  **Provide a clear description**: Explain what the PR does and why. Use the provided PR template.
4.  **Link to the issue**: If your PR resolves an issue, link it using `Fixes #<issue-number>`.
5.  **Self-review your PR** before requesting a review from others.
