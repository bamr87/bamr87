# SCHEMA — tools

> The dash's executable machinery: CLI, gates, generators, and fleet scripts.

## Conventions

- Shell for orchestration (`*.sh`, kebab-case); Python (stdlib + PyYAML) for gates and generators.

## Structure

| entry | kind | purpose | rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | file | Tools index | required |
| `dash` | file | Dash CLI entrypoint (status, audit, work orders) | required |
| `dash-gen` | file | Regenerates README AUTO spans and portfolio data from the registry | required |
| `Brewfile` | file | macOS dev dependencies | |
| `devtools.conf` | file | Shared config for the devtools scripts | |
| `fanout.sh` | file | Shared fan-out engine — clone→branch→seed→commit→PR loop with dry-run and external-upstream guard (called by standardize-fanout.yml and schema-fanout.yml) | |
| `*.sh` | pattern | One fleet/ops script per concern, kebab-case (gates, setup, fan-out seeds) | required |
| `*.py` | pattern | Python gate/generator tooling — includes the vendored schema_lint.py (see templates/schema/VERSION) | required |

## Placement

- New gate or generator → `*.py` here; new orchestration → `*.sh` here; document in README.md.

## Forbidden

- No secrets in scripts; tokens come from the environment or GitHub secrets.
