# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contribution Workflow

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Set up your development environment**. If the project has a `scripts/setup.sh` or similar, run it.
3.  **Make your changes**.
4.  **Add tests** for your changes.
5.  **Ensure the test suite passes**.
6.  **Format your code** using the project's code formatter.
7.  **Create a pull request** to the `main` branch.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples and the `README.md` to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
