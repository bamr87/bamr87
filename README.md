- üëã Hello world, I‚Äôm Amr, I hail from Denver, CO
- ü§ñ I'm a guru of IT system achitectures designed to facilitate the means of production (e.g., ERPs)
- üìö Mastering the full stack by writing about it (it-journey.dev), desining it, (zer0-mistakes.com), and scaling it (barodybroject.com)
- üßê Open to collaborate on new ways to incorporate sustainibility vs profit as a value based ERP driver (i.e., how to quantify environmental impact when competing with profit)
- üì´ You can reach me at @bamr87

Here's some of my progress:

One day, I will find a use for this 3D model. 

## 3D Model 

```stl

  facet normal 0.0 -1.0 0.0
    outer loop
      vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
    endloop
  endfacet
  facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
    outer loop
