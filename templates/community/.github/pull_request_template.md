## What and why

<!-- One or two sentences: what changes, and why now. -->

Closes #

<!-- Or, in a repo with a declared file backlog: `Backlog: BL-YYYYMMDD-NN` (spec-driven) or `Backlog: T-NNN`.
     Spec-driven repos also link the package: `Spec: specs/NNN-slug` -->

## Definition of Done

<!-- fleet-dod:start v1 -->
- [ ] **Title** is a Conventional Commit (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:` …). It becomes the squash subject and drives the next version and the release-please CHANGELOG entry. Never edit `CHANGELOG.md` or version numbers by hand.
- [ ] **CI is green**: tests, lint, build and the conformance check.
- [ ] **Tests** were added or updated for the change, or this box says why none apply.
- [ ] **Docs** are current (README-First, README-Last): the nearest `README.md`, `docs/`, `SCHEMA.md` if files were added, moved or removed, and `features/features.yml` if a user-facing capability changed.
- [ ] **Agent instructions**: `AGENTS.md` is updated if commands, layout or conventions changed. `CLAUDE.md` stays a pointer to it.
- [ ] **Decision recorded** in `docs/adr/NNNN-slug.md` if this is hard to reverse.
- [ ] **Backlog of record** is updated: the issue is linked above, or the backlog item is moved to Done in this PR.
- [ ] **Clean diff**: no secrets, lockfiles, generated artefacts or unrelated changes.
